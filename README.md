# E-Invoicing Compliance for Country-Specific Formats

This repository serves as a central hub to track and register our efforts in ensuring compliance with country-specific e-invoicing formats. Our goal is to integrate support for these formats into our main plugin: **PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce**.

## Supported Formats

### Germany: XRechnung (EN16931)

We have developed an extension to support **XRechnung**, Germany’s implementation of the **EN16931** e-invoicing standard. You can find the corresponding repository here:

➡️ [XRechnung](https://github.com/wpovernight/wpo-ips-xrechnung)

### Italy: FatturaPA (Under Development)

We are actively working on an extension to support the **FatturaPA** format required for e-invoicing in Italy. You can track progress in the corresponding repository:

➡️ [FatturaPA](https://github.com/wpovernight/wpo-ips-fatturapa)

### Romania: CIUS-RO (EN16931)

To comply with Romania’s e-invoicing regulations, we offer an extension supporting **CIUS-RO**, the country’s implementation of the **EN16931 UBL Invoice** standard. You can find the corresponding repository here:

## About the Main Plugin

Our main plugin, **PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce**, provides the foundation for generating PDF invoices and packing slips for WooCommerce stores. It includes support for the **UBL 2.1** format as the default e-invoicing standard. 

Country-specific e-invoicing formats are handled via extensions, such as those listed above.
