# E-Invoicing Compliance for Country-Specific Formats

This repository serves as a central hub to track and register our efforts in ensuring compliance with country-specific e-invoicing formats. Our goal is to integrate support for these formats into our main plugin: **PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce**.

## Supported Formats

### Germany: XRechnung

We have developed an extension to support the XRechnung format required for e-invoicing in Germany. You can find the corresponding repository here:

### Italy: FatturaPA

To meet the e-invoicing requirements in Italy, we offer an extension for the FatturaPA format. You can find the corresponding repository here:

## About the Main Plugin

Our main plugin, **PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce**, provides the foundation for generating PDF invoices and packing slips for WooCommerce stores. It includes support for the **UBL 2.1** format as the default e-invoicing standard. 

Country-specific e-invoicing formats are handled via extensions, such as those listed above.
